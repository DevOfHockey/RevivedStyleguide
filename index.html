        <p>
            Our app is called "Revived" and is about spreading awareness about fast fashion and encouraging people to participate in slow 
            fashion. The app shares different solutions of things you can do with old clothes such as donating, trading, and turning them 
            into something new. It also shares ways to take better care of your clothes, things you should consider before making a purchase 
            and how sustainable different clothing companies are. What our app is about is what we considered when coming up with an app name 
            and concept. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We chose the name "Revived", as revived means to "give new strength or energy to" and "improve the position or condition of" which 
            we felt was fitting for our app. Thatâ€™s why when creating our logo we wanted to show and incorporate that meaning into it.
        </p>

        <p>
            We decided to do a logo mark that showcases a plant vase that has a hanger on a plant stem in it. Instead of having a flower 
            growing out of the stem we did a hanger as our app is about fashion and we wanted to have a fashion aspect be part of the logo. 
            Some flowers regrow back as a new flower after they die. Our logo showcases the flower growing back as a new item which is the 
            hanger. It has a new use and purpose to it which matches what our app Revived is all about.
        </p>

        <p>
            The logo is mainly going to be on its own as a logo mark, but I provided some examples of it with a logotype with our chosen font 
            Open Sans (<a href="typography.html">Click here</a> to learn why we chose Open Sans as our font).
        </p>

        <p>
            The logo includes organic shapes such as leaves and modified geometric shapes (triangles, rectangles) used to make the hanger and vase. 
            These shapes represent creativity. When the audience sees our logo we want them to see how different shapes came together to create our 
            vision and spark creativity within them. 
        </p>

        <p>
            We wanted the logo to be simplistic and scalable. It was important to us that the logo had minimal details and that from a distance everyone 
            would be able to recognize the logo. We also wanted the logo to be unique and represent our app.
        </p>
