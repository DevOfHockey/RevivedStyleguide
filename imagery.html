    <h1>Imagery</h1>
    <p>Our unique graphical style revolves around simple infographical clothing imagery, as it's a simple way demonstrates the concepts shown to the user.</p>
    
    <p>This is paired with real life imagery, which complements the design as it helps our goal: getting the user to grasp the weight of the subject in real life. Without it, it would be less impactful and ineffective and conveying Revived's messaging as the person would feel detatched from it. </p>

    <p>Colors such as tan and greenery are used in accociation to people, clothing, luxury and the enviorment all together. </p>
